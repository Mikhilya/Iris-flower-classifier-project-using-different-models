# Iris-flower-classifier-project-using-different-models
Iris flower classification using different models.

In this project, i have taken the iris flower data set, did some preprocessing, data analysis and visualization with the help of seaborn and matplotlib libraries. Used **Label Encoder** to convert categorical features into the numerical values, applied **stratified K-fold** for better validation of the model, used different models like **Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier etc** to know which model is performing well. from the observations, all the models are performimg good and have high accuracy scores of >90%. K Neighbours Classifier, Logistic Regresssion and Support Vector Machine models perform more better than the other models.
